# How to run the project
In order to Demo the site please run 'gulp images' and then run 'gulp' from the gulp-webserver folder. The webserver should automatically open your browser to the site that has been created using a task created for gulp-webserver. In the event that it fails please try running the index.html file from the app folder.

Note that in the images directory the resized images are already included. They will need to be removed in order to run the task and for it to create the new images.
